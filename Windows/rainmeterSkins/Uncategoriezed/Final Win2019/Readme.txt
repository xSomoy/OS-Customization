INSTALLATIONS

To install this theme, copy the "Win2019" folder to C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Skins\

To install the CD Art Display theme, open the "CD Art Display" folder and copy the "Pure Adium" folder to C:\Program Files\CD Art Display\Skins\
To apply the theme right click the taskbar icon for CD Art Display > Skin > Pure Adium > For Enigma Sidebar

To install the Lanuchy skin, open the Launchy folder and copy the "Launchy2019" folder to C:\Program Files\Launchy\skins\
To apply, right click launchy while it's open, go to skins, click the Launchy2019 skin

To apply the system icons just right click on the program you want, click change icon, and choose whatever icon you want. 
*WARNING* The three icons in the "System Icons" folder are shortcuts that link to whatever their named and they WILL perform without a confirmation window so dont go clicking around

To make it really easy you can just copy the rainmeter.ini in the "Final 2019" folder to C:\program files\rainmeter\ or wherever you have it installed. If one allready exhists I suggest you backup the old one by just changing the name (If you use other skins and done want to mess them up) and replacing it with mine. This way everything will snap into place next time Rainmeter is started. Just make sure rainmeter is CLOSED before you do this or else when you do close Rainmeter it will overwrite the .ini

NOTES

The Dock icons folder are for a docking program or shortcuts. For example on my desktop I use them on the bottom left of the preview image with Object Dock(You can also use Rocket DocK). To make things pop out you need Object Docklet (or Rocket Docklet).

The system temperature tracker requires Speedfan to work. (http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php)

Theres a large space on the bottom between Launchy and the RSS buttons. What I did was ran rocketdock down there so I have a little icon bar. If you want you can do this too.

The RSS Toggles are a bit picky. To move them you have to left click and hold then move the mouse till its off the button. It should turn white. once white you can click and move it anywhere you want. Simply click it again to return it to its normal state.
